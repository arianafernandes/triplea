TripleA is a turn-based strategy game and board game engine. Though TripleA comes with many games inside, it
is just an engine for playing games, and is not a game itself. TripleA started out as a World War II simulation, but
has since expanded to include different conflicts, as well as variations and mods of popular games and maps (a
‘map’ is like a board, while a ‘game’ is a specific setup on a map/board).

#### History
TripleA was started in Oct 2001 by Sean Bridges.
He was looking for a way to build up his resume after the end of the tech bubble. 
Sean was too successful, and soon after the 0.1 release (which he managed to demo in a job interview)
he secured gainful employment.

#### Process
