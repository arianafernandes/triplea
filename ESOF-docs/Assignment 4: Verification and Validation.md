# Verification and Validation

## Introduction

<p align="justify">  Nowadays is very dificult to control the quality of products because there are too many standards and reviews. So this is the major reason why software tests are fundamental to every product. With them we can detect errors and failures in order to improve our work. </p>

### Controllability
<p align="justify">
Phase where is possible to control the state of the component to be tested (CUT) in accordance with the test.
POR COMPLETAR
</p>

### Observability
<p align="justify">Phase in which is possible to analyze the intermediate and final results of the tests.
POR COMPLETAR
</p>


### Isolateability

<p align="justify">Isolability represents the amount of each component (CUT) that can be tested isolated. 
In TrpleA the components communicate with each other, so is  very difficult to isolate one component from the rest. 
The component under test (CUT) can only be tested in isolation, partially.
</p>


### Separation of Concerns

<p align="justify"> Separation of concerns is the state in which the component to be tested has a unique responsibility which is well defined.

The TripleA has a well-defined concept division. The project is divided in 2 main packages. This division is very important because is the simplest way of avoiding repetition of code and creation of code that is of no use. This code structure method avoids introducing more bugs into the software.
</p>

### Understandability


### Heterogeneity

## Test Statistics

<p align="justify"> The statistics result of representative test cases to estimate a value of a qualility metric of software.
They determine the efficiency and the reliability of the system.
