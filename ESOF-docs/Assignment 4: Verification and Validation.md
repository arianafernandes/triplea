#Verification and Validation

## Introduction

<p align="justify">  Software tests are fundamental to every product. With software tests we can detect errors and failures. </p>
<p> </p>

###Controllability



###Observability

###Isolateability

<p align="justify">Isolability represents the amount from each component (CUT) that can be tested isolated. 
In TrpleA, the components communicate with each other. So it is difficult to isolate one component from the rest. 
The component under test (CUT) can only be tested in isolation, partially.

###Separation of concerns


###Understandability


###Heterogeneity

* Test statics 8pts
        code coverage (optional codacy.com)
        McCabe complexity (optional)

* Bug/defect -> fix  6pts
      make pull request (code standar + tests)
