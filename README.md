TripleA is a turn-based strategy game and board game engine. Though TripleA comes with many games inside, it
is just an engine for playing games, and is not a game itself. TripleA started out as a World War II simulation, but
has since expanded to include different conflicts, as well as variations and mods of popular games and maps (a
‘map’ is like a board, while a ‘game’ is a specific setup on a map/board).

Development 
===========
- [Initiatives and Projects](https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/issues/1073)
- [Bug backlog](https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Bug+Backlog%22)
- [Developer and Project Documentation](https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/tree/master/docs)

Developer Setup
===============
*Eclipse*
  - Import the project as a gradle project
  - Plugins to Install:
    - [Buildship plugin](https://github.com/eclipse/buildship/blob/master/docs/user/Installation.md)
    - [Gradle integration plugin](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/buildship-gradle-integration)

*Netbeans*
  - Use the [Gradle plugin](http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/44510/gradle-support)

*Intellij IDEA*
  - Import the project as a gradle project, specify the settings.gradle file
  - Plugins to Install:
    - [eclipse code formatter plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6546)
    - [eclipse launcher plugin (eclipser)](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7153?pr=idea)
      - Once installed, right click the eclipse launchers found in 'triplea/eclipse/launchers'
      - Select 'convert with eclipser', then the launchers will be available to run as intelliJ run configurations

Note that eclipse and NetBeans are currently not supporting JUnit 5. Therefore we use the JUnit 4 based Runner `JUnitPlatform.class` until there is official support. Apply it by annotating the JUnit 5 based class with `@RunWith(JUnitPlatform.class)`

  - *Troubleshooting*
    - If you are getting "JAVA HOME not yet set", see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31215452/intellij-idea-importing-gradle-project-getting-java-home-not-defined-yet

Development - Building
======================

[Gradle](http://gradle.org) is used. The gradlew (on Windows gradlew.bat) file is a proxy to execute build commands. 
On first call these files will install the correct version of Gradle on your system. Most commonly used commands:

* creates a jar file from the project, dependencies are not added:
```
./gradlew jar
# creates into build/libs/triplea-<version>.jar
./gradlew test
# compiles the project and runs the unit tests
./gradlew check
# runs the tests and runs the checkstyle application to be able to review the code quality
a report html page can be found under {projectDir}/build/reports/checkstyle/
```

* creates a self contained jar file from the project, all JAR dependencies are included
```
./gradlew shadowJar
# creates into build/libs/triplea-<version>-all.jar
```
* run the application right from the source (no jar is created); this may be used from inside an IDE to debug
```
./gradlew run
# creates into build/libs/triplea-<version>-all.jar
```

Building Game Installers and Travis Deployment
==============================================

On each and every merge to master, travis picks up, runs gradle, which then invokes builds, tests, and invokes install4j to create game installers. Travis then is configured to push the installer files to [github releases ](https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/releases)

More documentation on how build system is configured can be found in  the [/docs]
(https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/blob/master/docs/build_process.md)



Task and Issue Tracking
=======================

* Discussion - technical discussions, anything non-technical should be pushed to forum
* Feature Backlog - prioritized list of potential features
* Bug Backlog - prioritized list of bugs to fix
* Infra/Code Backlog - prioritized list of build, infra, code improvement, process, misc issues
* Next Release - what we are currently targeting for the next release (anything in progress should have an assignee)

Every issue should get a tag identifying whether it is a discussion, feature, bug, infra/code (couple of tags here). We then have tags to categorize the portion of TripleA experience it affects such as UI, performance, AI, game play/rules, map support, etc.

For the most part each issue should end up with 2 tags with 1 from each list (sometimes it might not get a second tag or have multiple tags from the second list).

For background and discussion, please see: See: https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/issues/1059
